Quick and dirty compilation notes
=================================

`./configure --disable-ogg --with-mad-libraries=libmad/.libs/ --with-mad-includes=libmad`

Modify configure to include -lmad at the correct path !!
Search for mad_frame_decode and then LIBS= and replace that with
`LIBS="-Llibmad/.libs -lmad $LIBS"`
... and also at _ACEOF too !!

Makefile
========

Afterwards, CFLAGS in Makefile (autogenerated) needs `-I. -Ilibmad` added.

BETTER: to redo aclocal.m4 etc so it can overide the default libary path.

splt.h 
======

change `parse_outformat` variable to:

char format [OUTNUM][MAXOLEN] from char format [][]

Runtime error occurs for mp3split so, need to copy *.o from libmad to current working directory and then:

gcc -o mp3split *.o -lm
